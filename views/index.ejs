<h1>Tutorial Therapy</h1>
<p>Art is a wonderful stress relief.  But sometimes, at the end of the day,
    the mind is too tired to jump into creativity.  But give me a a tutorial to 
    follow and all is well.  I just love some guidance in creating something 
    beautiful to ease my mind.  Here are some good ones from which to choose.
