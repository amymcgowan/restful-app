# RESTful App

I followed Colt Steele's lesson on RESTful routes in his Web Dev Bootcamp course.  After finishing the lesson, I decided to try to repeat the process and create a different app on my own.  

## Dependencies
- Mongo
- Express
- Mongoose

## Things to come back to
- Revisit some styling
- Make it so that can just input video id and then image and video links are auto created

## I LEFT OFF....
- DONE check edit route  
- DONE make update route 
- DONE method override 
- DONE ck edit template 
- figure out mongoose deprecated methods situation
- DONE streamline video id -> populate image/video links
- DONE make image on show page a link to the video as well
- DONE make 'watch video' button bigger/different from edit and delete buttons
- DONE better format show page, esp the p section
- DONE format tutorials page so that images have box shadow
- DONE improve responsiveness, esp on tutorials page
- figure out how to upload files
