# RESTful App

I followed Colt Steele's lesson on RESTful routes in his Web Dev Bootcamp course.  After finishing the lesson, I decided to try to repeat the process and create a different app on my own.  

## Dependencies
- Mongo
- Express
- Mongoose

## Things to come back to
- Revisit some styling
- Make it so that can just input video id and then image and video links are auto created
