# RESTful App

I followed Colt Steele's lesson on RESTful routes in his Web Dev Bootcamp course.  After finishing the lesson, I decided to try to repeat the process and create a different app on my own.  

Working on this project has helped me to understand routes, the process, and the pattern so much more.  I'm really glad I took the time to do it.

## Dependencies
- Mongo
- Express
- Mongoose

## This app helped me to practice...
- Backend.  This is my first real experience with dbs.
- Express
- Mongo/Mongoose
- partials
- ejs
- Semantic UI (didn't want to spend much time on styling; this was my first dive into this framework)
- RESTful routes
- npm
- html forms
- debugging, reading errors, reading documentation

## WHERE I LEFT OFF....
- DONE check edit route  
- DONE make update route 
- DONE method override 
- DONE ck edit template 
- figure out mongoose deprecated methods situation
- DONE streamline video id -> populate image/video links
- DONE make image on show page a link to the video as well
- DONE make 'watch video' button bigger/different from edit and delete buttons
- DONE better format show page, esp the p section
